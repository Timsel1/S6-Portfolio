# What kind of game would fit with the strange device ”the secret”?
As the first assignment of this semester strange devices were given out and 3 minigames had to be made per device. My group and I got the secret as our device, this device has an X amount of switches, 1 button and an indicator light.

## How did I solve this?
A brainstorming session started to come up with games that would fit with this device. The games that were made were posted in discord with their descriptions and rules, so everyone could see them and know what we were going to make.

I made up the game from the picture above. The idea behind this game was a game that is played in urban sports, like freerunning, it is called “add on”. in this game player 1 would perform a certain move, like a backflip, and player 2 would repeat this move and add a next move. This concept would fit really well with the secret.

## What is the result?
In the end 3 games were chosen to be added to the device, these games were:  
- Memory
- Code Master
- Add On
The rules and description of the games were posted in discord.

## What is the quality of the result?

## What is the next Step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to Create these minigames and test them, so that they are ready to be played by other people.
