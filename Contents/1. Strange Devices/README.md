# Launch Week - Strange Devices
In this derectory you will find devlogs on my activities during this week. These devlog are about designing a mini game, realizing and validating it.

## Assignment Description
The Launch Weeks are focused on defining yourself as a professional in the games industry.

What would your ideal role or position in a (game) company be? You will create a short CV of yourself and form your Game Studio group. 

Then, to refresh your Game Engine skills, you create a technical 'strange device'.

At the end of the week you give a short company pitch and your draft 1-page Game Design Document.

Your Game Studio is now ready to design, develop, and publish your own game.
