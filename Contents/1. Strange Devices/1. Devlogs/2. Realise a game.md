# What mechanics are needed for the game “Add On”?
Since I made up this game, I will realise it. When realising a product like this, first thinking of the needed mechanics is an important step. This way the gameplay will align with the concept of the "strange device" and I won't make any unnecessary features.

## How did I solve this?
I looked at the existing game and thought about how I could translate it to the device. 
Since you can only perform 1 move per turn, this would best translate to flipping 1 switch per turn. 
In the original game both parties know whether the correct moves have been performed, with the device, 
the sequence can become very lengthy, so the indicator light should function to confirm whether the correct order has been put in. 
This leaves only the button, the button could be used to end a player's turn on the device, this makes a clear indicator a new turn has started. 

## What is the result
I made my vision of the device with 9 switches, a button and the indicator light. Switches can be turned on and off each turn, so there are endless combinations and the game can be played with as many people as you want.

## What is the quality of the result?
For now the game has only been tested by the people in my group, and it got positive feedback, but the game will be tested later by other students as well as teachers.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to user test this game with people that are not part of my group.
