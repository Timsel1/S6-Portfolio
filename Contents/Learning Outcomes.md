# Learning Outcomes
In this document all learning outcomes are stated and explained. The documents used as evidence per learning outcome are also shown with the corresponding research methods from the DOT framework.

## LO1. Analysis 

You are able to obtain desired results by researching game related subjects (design and technical) methodically and thorough using the trends and developments in the industry.

Explanation: 

- With __desired results__ we mean that you can clearly define the relevant research question at hand to scope the problem at hand to a manageable scale. This includes being able to define a design challenge where you take the client, context and audience into account. 
- __Methodically__ means you show that you use justified research methods such as the DOT research framework.
- __Thorough__ means that you triangulate using different methods of analysis and validate your insights. 
- __Trends and developments:__ You are up to date with new trends and developments within the game industry such as: software algorithms, engines, game genres, new hardware, business models. You know when and how to use these in your products.

## LO4. Realization 

You show that you can develop and validate game prototypes,  based on a design where you create, find or adapt audio-visual and narrative assets using innovative and relevant technology in a complex context.

Explanation: 

- With __develop__ we mean that you are able to create technical prototypes based on prior work or from scratch. 
- You are __able to validate__ these prototypes to verify the quality of the product using for example user tests and heuristics. 
- With __based on designs__ we mean that the prototypes are based on prior designs. 
- With __create, find or adapt__ we mean that you can create basic assets, but more realistically will find existing assets and alter them to suit your aesthetic and technical needs. The goal is that you seek out a balance in creating assets from scratch and finding existing work. 
- With __audio-visual and narrative assets__, we mean all ‘art’ assets for your games such as: 2d art, 3d art, synthesized and/or recorded sound effects, (dynamic) music, story, scripts (dialogue). 
- You use __innovative and relevant technology__ that suit your needs such as VR headsets, Mobile devices, Game Controllers, Industry Standard Game Engines.
