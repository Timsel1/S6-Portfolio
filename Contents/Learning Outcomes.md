# Learning Outcomes
In this document all learning outcomes are stated and explained. The documents used as evidence per learning outcome are also shown with the corresponding research methods from the DOT framework.

## LO1. Analysis 

You are able to obtain desired results by researching game related subjects (design and technical) methodically and thorough using the trends and developments in the industry.

Explanation: 

- With __desired results__ we mean that you can clearly define the relevant research question at hand to scope the problem at hand to a manageable scale. This includes being able to define a design challenge where you take the client, context and audience into account. 
- __Methodically__ means you show that you use justified research methods such as the DOT research framework.
- __Thorough__ means that you triangulate using different methods of analysis and validate your insights. 
- __Trends and developments:__ You are up to date with new trends and developments within the game industry such as: software algorithms, engines, game genres, new hardware, business models. You know when and how to use these in your products.

## LO2. Advice 

You are able to make recommendations about the game design process and important decisions therein based on the conclusions and results from the analysis and clearly communicate these recommendations to relevant stakeholders. 

Explanation: 

- With __recommendations__ we mean suggestions that you make that will help achieve desired outcomes and long-term goals. 
- With __clearly communicate__ we mean that you communicate with the relevant stakeholders in an appropriate way. This includes written reporting and pitch presentations.

## LO3. Design 

You show that you can design a complex game in an analytical way using existing frameworks, theories, and models. You can validate game systems for both functional and aesthetic/experience requirements using industry standard methods and deliverables. 

Explanation: 

- __Analytical__ means that you work is based on prior analysis insights. You support your design choices with sources such as: Target User Research, Existing products analysis, available technology research, stakeholder analysis. 
- With __using existing frameworks, theories, and models__ we mean frameworks such as: UML, ERD, Design Patterns, MDA framework and Self Determination Theory as well as concept development methods such as diverging/converging and brainstorms.
- You __validate your designed game systems__ in an early stage using efficient and quick prototyping methods such as paper prototyping, roleplaying and wizard of Oz and use the results to refine your design.
- __Common industry standard methods and deliverables are:__ Game Design document, Tech design document consisting of elements such as UML diagrams and software architecture diagram and prototypes such as paper prototypes, mock-ups, and user tests. 

## LO4. Realization 

You show that you can develop and validate game prototypes,  based on a design where you create, find or adapt audio-visual and narrative assets using innovative and relevant technology in a complex context.

Explanation: 

- With __develop__ we mean that you are able to create technical prototypes based on prior work or from scratch. 
- You are __able to validate__ these prototypes to verify the quality of the product using for example user tests and heuristics. 
- With __based on designs__ we mean that the prototypes are based on prior designs. 
- With __create, find or adapt__ we mean that you can create basic assets, but more realistically will find existing assets and alter them to suit your aesthetic and technical needs. The goal is that you seek out a balance in creating assets from scratch and finding existing work. 
- With __audio-visual and narrative assets__, we mean all ‘art’ assets for your games such as: 2d art, 3d art, synthesized and/or recorded sound effects, (dynamic) music, story, scripts (dialogue). 
- You use __innovative and relevant technology__ that suit your needs such as VR headsets, Mobile devices, Game Controllers, Industry Standard Game Engines. 
- A __complex context__ means that the scope and complexity of both the situation and the product are representative of a real world industry setting.

## LO5. Manage and control 

You are able to work in a structured and methodical way both individually as well as in a group context where you use relevant processes and tooling to facilitate your iterative process in order to achieve a desired level of quality. 

Explanation: 

- With both __individually as well as in a group context__ we mean that you show you can adjust the process accordingly. 
- With __relevant processes and tooling__ we mean processes and tools that are industry standard in order to effectively communicate and cooperate such as Scrum, version control tools and build management tools. 
- With __quality__ we mean that you are able to define a level of quality to adhere to in accordance with stakeholders. Non-functional requirements such as stability, performance, security could be used to define these criteria. This includes elements such as automated tests, code reviews and continuous integration and building setups. 

## LO6. Professional skills

You demonstrate your professionalism as a Game Design specialist by the manner in which you perform during authentic IT professional tasks and the professional standard of resulting products. Process and products show your awareness of methodical problem solving, proactive project validation and quality monitoring and are self-explaining and transferable. You show and demonstrate you’re fit to work in a future-oriented organization and know what’s expected of you within such an organization. You can choose and justify a role which helps you become an expert in accordance with your personal development goals. You are able to prepare for your graduation internship.

Explanation:  

Being a future-oriented professional means that you:  

- You __are skilled and have the necessary emphatic ability__ to analyze a game design context including the (target) user’s needs and stakeholder’s expectations/requirements.
- Have the __necessary communication skills to inform and advice stakeholders__ within the project
- Act according to __ethical standards and show responsibility__ whenever ethical standards are at stake
_ Are able to __define the project’s need for information and are able to design a straightforward methodology__ to address this need using the DOT framework, method cards and method chaining.
- Are __proactive in describing and monitoring the quality of your work__ by incorporating validation and document your work effectively. As a result your work is reproducible and transparent. And your outcomes can be used by others (hand-over).
