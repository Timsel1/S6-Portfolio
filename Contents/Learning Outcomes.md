## LO4. Realization 

You show that you can develop and validate game prototypes,  based on a design where you create, find or adapt audio-visual and narrative assets using innovative and relevant technology in a complex context.

Explanation: 

- With __develop__ we mean that you are able to create technical prototypes based on prior work or from scratch. 
- You are __able to validate__ these prototypes to verify the quality of the product using for example user tests and heuristics. 
- With __based on designs__ we mean that the prototypes are based on prior designs. 
- With __create, find or adapt__ we mean that you can create basic assets, but more realistically will find existing assets and alter them to suit your aesthetic and technical needs. The goal is that you seek out a balance in creating assets from scratch and finding existing work. 
- With __audio-visual and narrative assets__, we mean all ‘art’ assets for your games such as: 2d art, 3d art, synthesized and/or recorded sound effects, (dynamic) music, story, scripts (dialogue). 
- You use __innovative and relevant technology__ that suit your needs such as VR headsets, Mobile devices, Game Controllers, Industry Standard Game Engines. 
- A __complex context__ means that the scope and complexity of both the situation and the product are representative of a real world industry setting.
