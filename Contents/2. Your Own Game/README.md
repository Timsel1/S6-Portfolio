# Game Studio Project (YOG)

Welcome to the Game Studio project, an exciting opportunity for you to operate as a mini-game studio. This project challenges you to work in groups of 3-6 people, potentially including an optional SintLucas intern, to create your own game. Here's how you can navigate through this adventure.
Getting Started

Form Your Team: Identify your group members, ensuring a mix of skills and interests to cover various aspects of game development.

Identify Roles: Key roles include a Creative Director and an Initial Scrum Master. The Creative Director oversees the creative direction, ensuring consistency and vision. The Scrum Master, experienced in project management, ensures the team adheres to Agile principles.

Develop Your Game Concept: Start with forming a game ambition that resonates with your team. Draft a 1-page Game Design Document (GDD) to outline your initial ideas.

Present Your Company and Game Ambition: In a 5-10 minute presentation, introduce your company, game concept, and how it aligns with your team's talents. Make your presentation visual and engaging.

Set Up Your Company's Identity: Decide on a company name, logo, and establish an online presence through a website and (of itch.io) community.

Create a Team Charter and Project Plan: Outline clear rules for working and communication, define roles (with flexibility), and aim for simplicity in your project plan.

## Scrum Process

The game design process typically progresses through several stages, each critical to developing a pitch for a successful game. 
### Suggestion 1: towards a pitch-able game prototype

The following suggested sprint planning is for a game that might still be far from a (pre-)release after 8 weeks. Its focus is on showing that your team and your game concept is viable.

#### Sprint 0 - Getting organized

Identify your team and ambitions - (see above)

#### Sprint 1 - Concept phase + first prototypes

Concept Phase (with GDD): This initial phase involves brainstorming ideas and outlining the game's vision. The Game Design Document (GDD) is created, detailing the game's concept, gameplay mechanics, story, characters, art style, and more. It serves as a roadmap for the development team.

Technical Prototypes: These are basic versions of the game used to test gameplay ideas, mechanics, and other technical aspects. The focus is on functionality rather than aesthetics, allowing designers to iterate quickly based on feedback.

#### Sprint 2 - Playable Demo

Playable Demo: A playable demo offers a short, functional piece of the game that showcases its key features, mechanics, and art style. It's used for internal testing, focus groups, or as a marketing tool to generate interest.

#### Sprint 3 - Vertical Slice

Vertical Slice: A vertical slice is a highly polished segment of the game that looks and feels like the final product. It includes finalized gameplay, art, sounds, and UI elements. This stage demonstrates the game's potential quality and play experience.

#### Sprint 4 - Pitch

Dragons' Den pitch: Present your game to a panel of 3-4 industry experts for feedback and evaluation. This is your chance to show off your hard work and potentially take a step toward becoming a real indie company.
    
Pitchable Trailer Video: This is a short video created to pitch the game to potential publishers, investors, or the gaming community. It highlights the game's concept, unique features, and gameplay to generate excitement and support. It's usually based on the vertical slice but can contain wizard-of-Oz extras.

### Suggestion 2: Towards a (pre)-release

The following suggested sprint planning is for a game that is intended to be fully playable after 8 weeks. Its scope will be smaller and build around a core that can easily be expanded on but can stand on its own.

#### Sprint 0 - Getting organized

Identify your team and ambitions - (see above)

#### Sprint 1 - Pre-Production + Planning

Pre-Production (with GDD): Focus on finalizing the game concept, creating concise but detailed GDDs, and defining the core gameplay mechanics. Begin asset creation or selection.
Planning: Create a clear timeline for all the features in your game.

#### Sprint 2 - Playable Demo (pre-alpha)

Playable Demo - Develop and implement the core gameplay mechanics. Create basic levels or environments and integrate essential game systems (e.g., scoring, health). It may contain a lot of placeholders.

#### Sprint 3 - Feature Completion & System Testing (alpha):

Externally Testable Game - Aim to have all major gameplay elements in place. Complete in UI/menus, sound, music, win state. May be still a bit buggy, but allows for testing with external people (a self-contained build).

#### Sprint 4 - Polish and pre-release (beta)

Pre-release build- Focus on polishing the game, enhancing the user interface, fixing bugs, and improving user experience as much as time allows.
   
Trailer - Present gameplay footage intended to invite players to test your pre-release.

 
## Dragons' Den

You present your final product and video in a pitch at the Dragons' Den.
