# Agile Work Method
Our group utilizes GitHub Projects as our Scrum board, where we manage our tasks using issues marked with Gitmojis, like in our commit and pull request conventions. To prioritize tasks, we begin each sprint by outlining our goals on a whiteboard. Together, we determine the objectives with the highest priority for the sprint and make sure to complete them by the end of the sprint. Making use of GitHub's automation, issues are automatically closed once linked to a pull request referencing the associated task, eliminating the need for manual scrum board updates for each task. However we do need to manually pick a task and drag it into the “in progress” lane.
