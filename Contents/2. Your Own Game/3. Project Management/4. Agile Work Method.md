# Agile Work Method

## Communication
Our team embraces agile methodologies as outlined in our group manifesto, which serves as the foundation for our agreements on communication. We prioritize democratic decision-making, allowing every member to speak their thoughts on a matter. Utilizing Discord as our primary communication platform, we make decisions through discussion and voting on issues, ensuring that everyone's input is considered.

To keep track of everyone’s progress, we conduct daily stand-up meetings, enabling quick updates and addressing any potential roadblocks. Additionally, our weekly meetings, such as the scrum of scrums and playtests, provide opportunities for collaboration, feedback, and alignment across different groups.

## Scrumboard
Our group utilizes GitHub Projects as our scrumboard, where we manage our tasks using issues marked with Gitmojis, like in our commit and pull request conventions. To prioritize tasks, we begin each sprint by outlining our goals on a whiteboard. Together, we determine the objectives with the highest priority for the sprint and make sure to complete them by the end of the sprint. Making use of GitHub's automation, issues are automatically closed once linked to a pull request referencing the associated task, eliminating the need for manual scrum board updates for each task. However we do need to manually pick a task and drag it into the “in progress” lane.
