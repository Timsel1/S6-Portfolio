# Project Management

- [Copy of the Group Manifesto](https://github.com/Timsel1/S6-Portfolio/blob/main/Contents/2.%20Your%20Own%20Game/3.%20Project%20Management/1.%20Group%20Manifesto.md)
- [Copy of the Code Convention](2.%20Code%20Convention)
Documents will be added which will describe how my work during the YOG project has been managed. This entails the studio's manifesto, code convention, scrum board and the way branches are made, reviewed and merged.
