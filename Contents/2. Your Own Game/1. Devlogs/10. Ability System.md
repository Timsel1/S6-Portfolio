# Implement the new ability system
At the moment abilities are separate scripts that need to be dragged onto the player, this was done to make things work for the dragon’s den. This is not practical and makes the process of adding new abilities longer, not to mention the amount of double code it generates. This will be changed for a system that has most central code and abilities will only have their effects in their script.
## How did I solve this?
Nathan had made a uml even before the dragon’s den of how this system should work. I reviewed it again now that I was going to work on this system and suggested small changes. These changes were to make the base ability inherit from a scriptable object and to have the casting method available in the base ability so we wouldn’t need to check for any inputs in the abilities themself. These methods are an ability used from the player character or placeable abilities (only needs the player’s position), a projectile (needs a spawn point and a direction). Nathan implemented these changes into the uml, since he has the plantuml code, and I could start my work.

## What is the result?
Now multiple abilities can be created with much greater ease and they only will require the vfx and ability specific code to be created.

## What is the quality of the result
I have created a new ability for the cast target "position", since we had none of this target type and I needed to test if the position cast was working correctly. the system functioned as intended, it made it quick and easy for me to create this ability. Instead of having to write another 200+ line script I was able to create it in about 60 lines of code.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
My next step with this system will be to create at least the "blackhole" ability. Other group members will use this system to connect to theirs, like progression and player stats.
