# How can a movement system prototype be created that will showcase the feel for the movement in Crusadeon?
During the first sprint I have been assigned to make a movement prototype, including a dash for the game. The goal of this prototype will be to showcase the feeling of the movement in this game. Movement is a very important aspect of the game and in combination with combat will be one of the most important mechanics to make the game fun.

## How did I solve this?
The first step was to choose a way to register player input, in unity there are multiple ways to do this. There is the old input system and the new input system, within the new input system there are again 4 different options. I have brought this to the attention of the group and gave [my input on this matter.](../2.%20Professional%20Documents/5.%20Input%20Stystem%20Advice.md)

I felt like we should use the new input system, since this way it would be very easy to implement controller support. This way we don’t have to write a separate check for controller inputs, unity will handle this for us. 

The group settled on using the new input system, with c# events, because of the convenience of the controller support and it will also result in cleaner code.

Now that a choice had been made, I started on writing a script that could read inputs, I had never worked with the new input system in combination with c# events, so I used chat gpt in combination with a tutorial to write the code.

## What is the result?
The player now has a basic way to move around, with a keyboard or controller and the movement speed can be changed.

## What is the quality of the result?
The code will be reviewed when a pull request is created and after this, depending on if changes need to be made, the controller will be tested by my group members.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
After the basic movement a dash feature will be added, to complete  this ticket from the scrum board.
