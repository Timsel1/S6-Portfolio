#   How should player rotation and attack rotation be determined?
This is a follow up on the [“How should attack direction be determined?” devlog](./04.%20Basic%20Attack%20Direction.md). Since the addition of the animations. With the way the direction was currently implemented (rotation always following the cursor) it became difficult to add the right animations. For example when the player was looking to the side but running down, a new animation was needed. I had implemented the logic for this, but the transitional logic didn’t look good and felt clucky to play because of this.

## How did I solve this?
Since it was decided to use the cursor as the attack direction for the upcoming playtest, the thing that needed to be changed was the look direction when walking. This would be an easy fix, since this code already existed, but was inactive due to a check for a controller. Removing this check and removing the code to turn the player to rotate in the cursor’s direction would fix our issue. With this logic only the running forward animation is needed to move the player around and separate animations for running backwards became unnecessary. 

## What is the result?
The player now always plays the running forward animation when moving and to rotate during movement follows the movement keys that are being pressed. The player can attack in the direction of the cursor, this way the shortcomings mentioned in the [“How should attack direction be determined?” devlog](./04.%20Basic%20Attack%20Direction.md) are also solved, the player can attack in any direction they want even if it isn’t within one of the 8 possible movement input directions.

## What is the quality of the result?
This felt way better to play to me as well as the studio members. It was decided to use this for the playtest and collect feedback. If further change was needed it would be done after the playtest.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The movement and rotation of the player are done for now and will only be changed if needed based on feedback that will be received during the playtest.
