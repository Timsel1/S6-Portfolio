# Berserker Enemy
The minimum deliverable of enemies was 3 unit types, not including a boss enemy. At the moment we have 2 types, the axe unit and the javelin unit. To meet the minimum number of enemies, the group discussed which enemy could realistically be added with the time we had left, this ended up being the berserker unit. Since I was the one to work out the enemies in the second version of the 10 pager and our enemy unit developer was working on the boss fight, I took it upon myself to implement this enemy.

## How did I solve this?
I looked back at the description of the berserker, the berserker was supposed to be a bigger melee unit that can take 3 times as much damage as an axe unit. They are supposed to charge at people and have a rage state when their health gets below a certain threshold, when they are enraged, they cannot be stunned and get a boost in attack power, until they die or get healed above this threshold.

Since I had little time I knew I couldn’t include the rage mechanic, but since the most important thing was for him to have a different attack than the other units, for them to just have their charge attack will do. With our current system, giving the berserker more health and damage is easily done and making him larger is just scaling his model, so the berserker will now always be enraged, charging blindly at the player.
Looking up extra information on the berserker this would actually fit his class better, since berserkers were always fearless and full of rage when in battle.

This will of course change the original dynamic that was documented, from making sure the berserker doesn’t get the chance to rage to now making sure you take care of the berserkers while they are not charging at you. This should aid the challenge aesthetic since there is now an extra thread you really don’t want to get hit by and also the power fantasy sensation aesthetic by defeating an enemy twice the size of the player, hopefully giving them a feeling of empowerment.

## What is the result?
The berserker has been added before the final playtest and can be tested during this playtest. It has a charge attack, which is indicated by a scream beforehand, to show the range from this unit. By playtesting myself I found out they needed a short period of time after their charge, before getting ready to attack again, since it would otherwise be impossible to take them down. So I have added a “confused” state to their behaviour, after their charge they get a little of their senses back from their blind rage, before coming after the player again.

## What is the quality of the result?
The results from the playtest indicated the berserker was a welcome addition to the enemy force. Being well balanced, but with some bugs in his animation and attack. Some people felt they needed to prioritize the berserker, like intended, while others thought it was not as scary as the other units. Validating what I was testing this unit on as can be read from the [evaluation criteria from my test plan](./4.%20Playtests/6.%20Final%20Playtest%20Test%20Plan.md#evaluation-criteria). The results of the test can be read in the [final test report document](./4.%20Playtests/9.%20Final%20Test%20Report.md).

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
I’m planning to fix some bugs with the berserker with the time I have left, before the innovation inside event.
