# Attack indication implementation
After choosing an attack indicator that will work for Crusadeon, it has to be implemented.

## How did I solve this?
To see how I could change the color of an enemy, I looked at our enemies and their materials, I messed around with every color-related setting to see if it could create the effect I was looking for. By doing this I quickly found color under emission, by setting the intensity of this color I was able to achieve my goal.

The next step was to create the pulsing effect. to quickly get a working prototype is used ChatGPT, with its help I quickly got this update function which works well.

Now all I had to do was add functionalities like resetting the emission, adding a modular color, so it can be changed in the inspector and making a toggle to turn the emission on and off.

## What is the result?
Using animation events I was able to start and stop the emission at the correct moment of the enemy unit attack animation Giving the enemies a new attack indicator which can be used for every single enemy type in the game.

## What is the quality of the result?
After testing I noticed a bug related to the enemy behaviour. When an enemy starts its attack it is possible for them to stop the attack mid animation and start chasing the player again. Since the attack indicator is toggled on and off with animation events, when the event for turning off the emission is never reached, the enemy will pulse when they are chasing the player and stop when they are attacking.  
To solve this I had to ask the studio what the intended behaviour of the enemies was, if the intended behaviour was to stop the animation to chase after the player again mid attack, I would have to change my approach, if it is the other way around, the enemy designer would have to fix this bug. Since the intended behaviour was to finish the attack before chasing the player I did not have to change my approach.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The feature will need to be tested during a playtest, this can be done when the bug is fixed.
