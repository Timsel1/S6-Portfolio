# Blackhole 
The minimum deliverable of abilities was 5 different abilities. At the moment we have 4 types, Smite, Wave, Spear and Laser. Since I was the one to work out the abilities in the second version of the 10 pager and the blackhole vfx was already finished, I took it upon myself to implement this ability.

## How did I solve this?
The requirements for this ability were that enemies would get pulled together toward a single point. With the new ability system in place that was the only bit of logic I would need to write for this ability to work. The cooldown, radius and charges could all be added with the new ability system.  

When implementing this I got a tip from Davey to reuse the knockback script with negative force to, instead of knocking back enemies, pull them together, this worked well. Enemies were pulled toward a single point but would go back and forth since they would shoot a little past the middle and then be pulled back. There was also the fact that the vfx has a spinning effect, so it would make more sense for the enemies to be sucked toward this point while going around following the vfx. This would give the effect of the enemies actually being sucked towards this point for the duration of the ability and hopefully aid in the sensation aesthetic.

## What is the result?
The blackhole ability is now functional and can be tested during the final playtest. It sucks in all enemies in a set radius and makes them follow the vfx by spinning them around its center.

## What is the quality of the result?
The ability has been tested during the final playtest and sadly was deemed to be too weak. In contrast to what we, the developers, believed to be one of the more powerful abilities, despite not dealing damage. Most players also did not use the ability as we intended, even though it was used to pull enemies away, it was hardly ever used in combination with one of the damage dealing abilities. The results of the test can be read in the [Final Test Report document](./4.%20Playtests/9.%20Final%20Test%20Report.md).

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The radius of the blackhole will be increased, to at least make it a little more viable and if time allows it a damage aspect will be added at the end of the ability.
