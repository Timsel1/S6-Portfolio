# What type of enemy attack indicator would work well in Crusadeon for this stage of development?
It needs to be clear for the player when an enemy is about to attack/deal damage to them. To make this clear attack indicators are used. Since there are many different ways to use these indicators a choice has to be made as to what indicator to use for Crusadeon. 

## How did I solve this?
First I looked up the multiple ways to indicate enemy attacks, I ended up with 3 ways to telegraph enemy attacks to players. These methods are: 
- Audio cues 
- Visual cues
- Force Feedback

These categories each have multiple ways of indicating enemy attacks. But since Crusadeon will be mainly developed for pc I will leave force feedback out of the equation for now and continue with audio and visual cues.
- Audio
  - Voice over:
    An enemy would announce their attack right before doing it, letting the player know exactly what kind of attack will be coming their way.
  - Sound effect:
    The player will hear a chosen sound effect, e.g. a pinging sound, when the enemy is done charging their attack and about to hit the player.
- Visual
  - Charging effect:
    An enemy could be drawing their bow and some energy may surround them to indicate when the enemy is ready to attack.
  - Enemy flashing:
    An enemy will start flashing a certain color when they are charging, when they are ready they will stop and attack.
  - Telegraphing:
    The enemy will have a certain animation, with a small window before they start doing damage, players will have to learn to recognize these animations.
  - Laser:
    Used for ranged enemies, while a ranged enemy is aiming at you a line will be shown to indicate where they are looking. This line stops moving when the enemy is ready to attack and will indicate where the projectile will fly.
  - AOE indicator:
    An indicator to show the area of effect of an attack, this can be used for ranged attacks as well as physical attacks. E.g. a circle on the ground which the player needs to avoid to make sure they don’t get hit.

## What is the result?
Since the player will face a lot of enemies at the same time, will be using abilities and hearing background music, audio cues seem too overwhelming. The player might not hear them because of all the other sounds and if every enemy has an indicator when attacking, the sound could start to get annoying. Because of these reasons it seems best to go with visual cues, this does not mean enemies won’t make any sounds in the final game.

Out of the options for the visual cues it would be best to choose an option that could work with all enemy types. This would eliminate the laser since this wouldn’t be a good indicator for the melee units.   
At this moment in the development there are no enemies which have an AOE attack, so this indicator will also not be a good fit, but could be used when these types of enemies are added and will probably become a necessity.

This leaves the charging effect, flashing effect and telegraphing. At this moment in development we don’t have any enemies which use any kind of magic/holy powers, so a charging effect wouldn’t fit at the time,
this effect also wouldn’t work for every enemy in the long run.

The best 2 options seem to be telegraphing and enemy flashing, both these options can be used for every enemy type in the game and seem to be clear indications for attacks. 
The enemies currently already have animations which are used to telegraph attacks, but these were not clear enough in our opinion and this was reflected during our first playtest. 
So in conclusion a combination of telegraphing and enemy flashing would be a solution which would fit with every enemy type currently in the game and every enemy that could be added.

## What is the quality of the result?
The result of this research still needs to be tested since the implementation has yet to start.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to implement this result into crusadeon.
