# Implement a new player attack hitbox
The sword the player uses is too small to act as the hitbox for our attacks. The player needs to get so close to the enemy that it makes it impossible not to get hit in return. To make the basic attack viable again a new hitbox is needed, so that players won't automatically get hit when using the basic attack and the area of effect of a swing is larger.

## How did I solve this?
I looked up ways to handle melee attack hitboxes in 2.5D games, a couple of sources seemed to have ideas in the same direction I was thinking of. I already used animation events to enable and disable the hitbox, this way I can choose exactly what the active frames of an attack should be, so I wanted to keep this. These sources spawn in colliders during the animation.

I also asked ChatGPT for different ways to implement a melee attack hitbox in a 2.5 dimension game. I got multiple different options, but there was a combination of 2 options which I already had in mind.

The idea I got from all these sources was to have a reference to an attack hitbox, which would be a box collider in front of the player, that would match the animation and VFX. This way it would be easy to change the size of the player's hitbox and I would be able to change the size and position of the hitbox for each basic attack.

## What is the result?
The player now has a hitbox in front of them that will activate based on an animation event. This hitbox can easily be scaled and positioned with animation events to match the player’s attack.

## What is the quality of the result?
During the first playtest it was evident the basic attack was viable for the players. Positive feedback was received and for the foreseeable future no changes were needed for the attack hitbox.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
This feature is finished for now, until new bugs are found or we are changing our combat system.
