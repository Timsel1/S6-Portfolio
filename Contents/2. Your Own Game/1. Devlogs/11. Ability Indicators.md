# Create ability indicators so players can aim their abilities
With the addition of new abilities like the code named laser beam, indicators need to be made, especially for controller players. Since these abilities need to be placed it would greatly improve the ux if the player knows where they are placing these abilities and how big the radius is. So the goal is to improve the experience of players by making it clear where their abilities will be cast and what the area of effect is, for both keyboard/mouse and controller players.

## How did I solve this?
I started by looking into what these indicators would need to look like, so I researched what these indicators look like in other games, this can be read [here](./5.%20Research/03.%20Indicator%20Visuals.md). To verify this I designed indicators that are just a shape and more holy looking indicators and asked some people to see if it improved their experience (help with the sensation aesthetic).

After this I needed to choose a system to show these indicators, I again did research, which can be read [here](./5.%20Research/04.%20Indicator%20System.md), to see how other people/companies do this and found a great solution. I could use unity’s decal projectors to show the indicators on the ground, this way the indicators wouldn’t clip through anything and would mold to the ground. Now I don’t need them to hover above the ground when there is a terrain change, so the indicators won’t clip through enemy ankles.
Now all that was left to do was to create a system to show these indicators and make them behave correctly based on the type of ability. For the position and self cast, this was extremely easy, I just moved the projector to the position of the player or cursor and showed it there. The direction and projectile abilities proved more difficult. The indicator should always point to the cursor by turning and adjusting its position. I ended up using Chat GPT to help me make this functionality.

## What is the result?
Crusadeon now has indicators that can be used to aim and show the area of effect of abilities. It’s currently missing controller support.

## What is the quality of the result? 
The indicators have been tested (shape vs holy looking), out of the test it became clear there was a preference for the holy looking indicators. The shape indicators looked out of place and took people out of the game, in contrary the holy looking indicators looked like they belonged there and the designs were well received.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to implement controller support for the indicators (and new ability system in its entirety).
