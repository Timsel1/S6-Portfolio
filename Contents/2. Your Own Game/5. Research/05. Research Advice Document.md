# Advice Document
Here all my research documents will from the YOG project will be linked. For each of these documents a piece of advice will be written, to accommodate the learning outcome advice.

## [Input System](01.%20Input%20System%20Research.md)
For most projects, especially those aiming for complexity, multi-device support, or advanced input features, transitioning to Unity’s new input system is recommended. Its flexibility, performance benefits, and advanced functionality will generally outweigh the initial learning curve and setup time. However, for straightforward or legacy projects where simplicity and quick implementation are more important, the old input system remains a viable option. Even though it is a viable option I would still recommend implementing the new input system, since after installing it, unity supports both systems, this means that for actual gameplay the new input system can be used and the old system can be used to quickly test a feature. This also means you can easily reuse code you made in a different project whether it is based on the old or new system.

The new input system is recommended for both big or small projects, even if you plan on making a small project, it is recommended to be installed so code from other projects can be used, whether they include the old or new input system.

## [Dash Cancel](02.%20Dash%20Cancel.md)
Because of the current circumstances my advice would be to not implement dash cancelling, purely based on time constraints. We currently have sprints full of tasks that need to be finished. Our stakeholders are expecting the minimal features we have promised and dash cancelling was not part of these features.

But if these time constraints weren’t a factor, my recommendation would be the exact opposite. Dash cancelling has the potential to enhance player control, combat fluidity, and skill expression, implementing dash canceling would be advisable for Crusadeon. It should (it has not been tested) align well with the game's aesthetics and could improve the player’s experience by making the game more dynamic and engaging. 

## [Indicator Visuals](03.%20Indicator%20Visuals.md)
I advise creating visually distinct ability indicators fitting with Crusadeon's holy theme. For circular areas, design intricate holy circles that follow the mouse or player character, enhancing the magical and immersive experience. For projectile aiming, implement thicker, stylized arrows that incorporate the same holy elements as the circle, indicating direction clearly. For square area effects, use scalable shapes like squares and circles with a yellow tint to maintain clarity while fitting the aesthetic. These custom indicators should be visually appealing, thematically coherent, and functional, contributing to a more immersive and engaging experience.

## [Indicator System](04.%20Indicator%20System.md)
For implementing ability indicators I’d advise using Unity (decal) projectors, they seem to be the best solution. This approach ensures indicators align accurately with the terrain, avoid clipping through objects, and maintain visual consistency across different screen sizes, you even get the choice of which layers it projects on. To move your indicator, all you need to do is move the projector, you also need only 1 projector for all your indicators, since you can change the decal it projects. Projectors allow for easier scaling and better integration into the game world, enhancing immersion and providing a seamless, intuitive experience for the player.
