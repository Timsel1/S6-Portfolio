# What should the ability indicators look like?
I will be working on ability indicators. There are different ability types in crusadeon and they may need different indicator types. I want to find out what other games use for these same types of abilities and take inspiration from them.
## How did I solve this?
I first listed the ability types I would need indicators for, these would be circular areas, square areas and aiming for projectiles. For the area indicators, they should either rotate around the player, be on the player or follow the mouse.
I looked at other peoples solutions and moba games, since they have a lot of indicators for their character abilities. With the amount these types of games have, it is almost guaranteed there are options for what I’m looking for. The moba I’ll be looking at is League of Legends.

## What is the result?
For the __circular area ability__ the most used indicator seemed to be a magic circle (since most examples used a magic system), instead of just an empty circle. This is most likely done to fit in with these games' fantasy aesthetic.

So to make these abilities fit with our holy powers, I will ask our artist to draw some holy circles that fit with our aesthetic. Some examples I could quickly find were:

__Projectile abilities__ mostly used an arrow to indicate where the projectile was going, some games made it a bit more fancy, like League of Legends, again to fit with their aesthetic. These arrows have a set length and because of this won’t need to be scaled for the distance the projectile will fly. Again I will ask our artist to make an arrow, that will be a little thicker and has some holy aspects to it.

__The square area of effect indicators__ seem a little more empty, compared to the rest, my assumption would be that this is due to scalability. Since this area can be scaled separately on width and length the indicator could start to look weird when it gets stretched in its width or length only. Taking this into consideration I’ll let our artist draw a scalable empty square that will have a yellow tint in its area of effect to act as a holy glowing effect.

## What is the quality of the result?
I have indicator ideas I can give to our artist to be drawn. These ideas have taken scalability and the aesthetic of our game in mind, to not take the player out of their magic circle.

## What is the quality of the result?
TBD
