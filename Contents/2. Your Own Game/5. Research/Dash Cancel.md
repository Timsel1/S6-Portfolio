# Dash Cancel Research
In crusadeon we aim for an action rogue-lite power fantasy experience with fluid combat. We have heard on multiple occasions that some attacks/abilities feel choppy due to disabling inputs for a short time. One of these abilities is the dash, some people thought it was too long, others asked why you couldn’t cancel the dash to attack quicker. This sparked the question, should we add a dash cancel to our game?

## Aesthetic goal
Crusadeon’s main aesthetic is sensation, and we aim to achieve this with a power fantasy experience. The player should become more powerful by collecting items during their run like e.g. in vampire survivors. The difference between Crusadeon, except for the visuals and 3d environment, are that Crusadeon offers an extra bit of control. There are no auto attacks, as a player you choose what enemy to attack and in what way. So how does the dash fit into this?

## Current Dash Mechanic
The current dash mechanic is mainly used to escape enemies/tough situations or dodge projectiles. With the current dash mechanic it feels like a commitment to dash, because of the input lag. This leads to the dynamics being fleeing or dodging using the dash. Even though this is an important part of the game, it doesn’t really fit the image of a powerful crusader, able to defeat large groups of vikings. It is also difficult to use the dash in combination with an ability, since when using an ability after you just dashed, you’re likely to get hit. So will a dash cancel solve the current problems?

## Dash Cancel Effect
**Enhanced Player Control**: Allowing players to cancel a dash at any point to perform an attack or ability significantly increases responsiveness.  

**Fluidity in Combat**: Dash cancelling introduces a seamless transition between movement and attacks, imbuing combat with a dynamic and smooth flow. This fluidity intensifies engagements, heightening the overall excitement and engagement of combat scenarios. 

**Strategic Depth**: Dash cancelling adds layers of tactical flexibility to gameplay, enabling players to strategically reposition themselves mid-fight. This strategic depth amplifies the complexity of combat encounters, encouraging adaptive gameplay and nuanced decision-making.  

**Skill Expression**: Mastery of dash cancelling becomes a marker of skill, as players adept at timing and decision-making maximize their effectiveness. This skill ceiling rewards experienced players and fosters a sense of accomplishment and progression. 

**Power Fantasy**: Interrupting a dash to unleash powerful attacks reinforces the player's sense of empowerment and dominance. This aligns seamlessly with power fantasy themes, amplifying the sensation of being an unstoppable force on the battlefield. 

**Momentum**: Dash cancelling sustains gameplay momentum, ensuring that action remains continuous and thrilling. This momentum preservation further solidifies the player's immersion in the game world and their role as a formidable warrior.

## Conclusion
Implementing a dash cancel introduces several advantages, like increased responsiveness, enhanced combat fluidity, and greater tactical flexibility. These elements lead to a more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience, rewarding skilled players with opportunities for skill expression and empowerment. The ability to interrupt a dash to unleash attacks aligns with the sensation aesthetic of the power fantasy experience we are aiming for. It enhances the player's sense of being an unstoppable force, maintaining continuous gameplay that reinforces the feeling of empowerment and dominance.

However, the addition of a dash cancel also comes with its own challenges, such as the need for a new animation, balancing considerations, and a little bit of additional development work. Addressing these challenges is crucial to make sure that the mechanic is well implemented and contributes positively to the overall game experience.

These challenges can be avoided by retaining the traditional dash mechanic, allowing us to preserve existing animations and not increase the current workload. This approach may result in a less responsive and dynamic gameplay experience and potentially a lower skill ceiling. The lack of dash canceling might make the dash feel like a rigid commitment, detracting from the fluidity and intensity that a power fantasy demands.

Ultimately, to decide to implement a dash cancel, we should consider its priority and the time needed to implement this mechanic.
