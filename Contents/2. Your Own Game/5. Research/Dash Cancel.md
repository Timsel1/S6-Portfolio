# Dash Cancel Research
In crusadeon we aim for an action rogue-lite power fantasy experience with fluid combat. We have heard on multiple occasions that some attacks/abilities feel choppy due to disabling inputs for a short time. One of these abilities is the dash, some people thought it was too long, others asked why you couldn’t cancel the dash to attack quicker. This sparked the question, should we add a dash cancel to our game?

## Aesthetic goal
Crusadeon’s main aesthetic is sensation, and we aim to achieve this with a power fantasy experience. The player should become more powerful by collecting items during their run like e.g. in vampire survivors. The difference between Crusadeon, except for the visuals and 3d environment, are that Crusadeon offers an extra bit of control. There are no auto attacks, as a player you choose what enemy to attack and in what way. So how does the dash fit into this?

## Current Dash Mechanic
The current dash mechanic is mainly used to escape enemies/tough situations or dodge projectiles. With the current dash mechanic it feels like a commitment to dash, because of the input lag. This leads to the dynamics being fleeing or dodging using the dash. Even though this is an important part of the game, it doesn’t really fit the image of a powerful crusader, able to defeat large groups of vikings. It is also difficult to use the dash in combination with an ability, since when using an ability after you just dashed, you’re likely to get hit. So will a dash cancel solve the current problems?

## Dash Cancel Effect
**Enhanced Player Control**: Allowing players to cancel a dash at any point to perform an attack or ability significantly increases responsiveness.  
**Fluidity in Combat**: Dash cancelling introduces a seamless transition between movement and attacks, imbuing combat with a dynamic and smooth flow. This fluidity intensifies engagements, heightening the overall excitement and engagement of combat scenarios. 
**Strategic Depth**: Dash cancelling adds layers of tactical flexibility to gameplay, enabling players to strategically reposition themselves mid-fight. This strategic depth amplifies the complexity of combat encounters, encouraging adaptive gameplay and nuanced decision-making.  
**Skill Expression**: Mastery of dash cancelling becomes a marker of skill, as players adept at timing and decision-making maximize their effectiveness. This skill ceiling rewards experienced players and fosters a sense of accomplishment and progression.  
**Power Fantasy**: Interrupting a dash to unleash powerful attacks reinforces the player's sense of empowerment and dominance. This aligns seamlessly with power fantasy themes, amplifying the sensation of being an unstoppable force on the battlefield.  
**Momentum**: Dash cancelling sustains gameplay momentum, ensuring that action remains continuous and thrilling. This momentum preservation further solidifies the player's immersion in the game world and their role as a formidable warrior.
