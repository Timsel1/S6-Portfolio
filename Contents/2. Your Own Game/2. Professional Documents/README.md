# Professional Documents
Most of these documents are group documents (01, 02, 03, 07), my contribution is not immediatly clear, so I will describe my contribution here.

 - 1 pager  
The idea for the game was made up before the semester started, out of the ideas Crusadeon was chosen to be developed. There was no input from me in the 1 pager.
 - 10 pager  
  Since most of the ideas were already made up, I was chosen to start on a player prototype, because not everyone needed to work on the 10 pager, because of this my contribution was for the control scheme of the player.
 - Pitch presentation  
A whiteboard sessions was held to determine what would be important for the presentation. I would participate in this sessions and add ideas to the board, after narrowing things down one person of the group made the presentation.
 - Dragons pitch
A whiteboard sessions was held to determine what would be important for the presentation. I would participate in this sessions and add ideas to the board, after narrowing things down one person of the group made the presentation.
