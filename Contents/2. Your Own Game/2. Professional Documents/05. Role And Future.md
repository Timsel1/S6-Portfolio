# Role and Future

## Current role within Rogue Ape Studio
__Programmer__  
I currently hold the position of programmer, specializing in the development of the player's combat system within the game. My responsibilities include:  
- Combat System Development:   
Leading the design and implementation of the player's combat mechanics, ensuring they are engaging, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay experience.
- Code Optimization:  
Writing clean, efficient code to ensure smooth performance and scalability of the combat system across various platforms and hardware configurations.
- Bug Fixing and Maintenance:  
Identifying and resolving any technical issues or bugs related to the combat system, and providing ongoing support to maintain its functionality.
- User Experience Optimization:  
Ensure that the combat system is intuitive and seamlessly integrated into the overall gameplay experience. This involves refining controls, balancing and addressing any usability issues to enhance player immersion.
- Collaboration:  
Working closely with other members of the development team, to ensure that the combat system aligns with the overall vision and design of the game.

Since we are a team of 6 I donâ€™t devote all of my time to programming the player, I also for example add map scenery or animations. When the player related tasks for a sprint are done I help out where I can.

## Future
After this semester I will enroll in the minor XR Design, here I will learn about VR development. I plan on designing a VR game during that time and learn more about optimization, since a VR headset is not as powerful as a gaming laptop. This will also be my last semester before my graduation internship, so I will also look into graduation internships during this time. 

I have experience in different fields of IT, in my first 3 semester here I have mostly learned about a system's backend and architecture, partly in semester 3 and in semester 5 I have learned to develop a frontend for websites using typescript, with React ([S3](https://github.com/S3IP/Portfolio)) and Lit Elements ([S5 internship](https://github.com/Timsel1/PortfolioS5)). During semseter 4 and 6 I have specialized in game development, further improving my c# and Unity knowledge.

With this experience I will look for an internship in either frontend, backend, serious gaming or game design. To me a software assignment can be just as interesting as a game design assignment. 
I will try to get an offer by the end of the internship, if I do that will be the field I end up in. If this doesn't happen I will take a parttime job while looking for a software development job.
