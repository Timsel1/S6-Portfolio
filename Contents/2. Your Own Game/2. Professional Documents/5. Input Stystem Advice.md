# Input System
A game obviously needs an input system, otherwise a player wonâ€™t be able to play it. Unity offers 2 ways of handling input, Legacy Input Manager (Old input system) and Entity Component System (New input system). Since I was the first to start prototyping in unity, and work on the player, I had to substantiate why we should use the new input system.
## Differences
### Old Input System:
- Legacy Input Manager:  
Unity's old input system is primarily based on the legacy Input Manager. It uses the Input class for handling user input events.
- Single Input Frame:  
In the old system, input is checked and processed once per frame in the Update() function.
- Limited Input Features:  
The old system lacks some advanced features like input remapping, input actions, and input control schemes out-of-the-box.
- Less Flexible:  
It can be less flexible when it comes to handling complex input scenarios, such as multi-device support or input rebinding.
### New Input System:
- Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture:  
The new Input System is built on top of Unity's Entity Component System, making it more efficient and scalable.
- Input System Package:  
It's available as a separate package in Unity, allowing for modular use and updates independent of the engine itself.
- Input Action Asset:  
The Input System introduces the concept of Input Action Assets, which define reusable sets of input actions that can be easily configured and reused across projects.
- Rebinding Support:  
It provides built-in support for input rebinding, allowing users to remap controls easily without having to write custom code.
Advanced Features:  
It offers advanced features like input interactions (e.g., hold, tap, swipe), composite controls (e.g., two-axis input like WASD), and multi-device support out-of-the-box.
Performance:  
The new system is designed for better performance, especially in scenarios with high-frequency input polling or complex input handling requirements.

## Points of Excellence
### Old Input System:
- Simplicity:  
It's straightforward to use, especially for simpler projects or prototypes.
- Familiarity:  
Developers who have been using Unity for a long time might find it easier to stick with the old system due to familiarity.
### New Input System:
- Flexibility:  
It's highly flexible and can handle complex input scenarios more efficiently.
- Performance:  
Offers better performance, especially in projects with demanding input requirements.
- Extensibility:  
The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization to fit specific project needs.
- Rebinding Support:  
Built-in support for input rebinding makes it easier to cater to a wider audience with different control preferences.
