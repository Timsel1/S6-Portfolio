# Input System
A game obviously needs an input system, otherwise a player won’t be able to play it. Unity offers 2 ways of handling input, Legacy Input Manager (Old input system) and Entity Component System (New input system). Since I was the first to start prototyping in unity, and work on the player, I had to substantiate why we should use the new input system.
## Differences
### Old Input System:
- Legacy Input Manager:  
Unity's old input system is primarily based on the legacy Input Manager. It uses the Input class for handling user input events.
- Single Input Frame:  
In the old system, input is checked and processed once per frame in the Update() function.
- Limited Input Features:  
The old system lacks some advanced features like input remapping, input actions, and input control schemes out-of-the-box.
- Less Flexible:  
It can be less flexible when it comes to handling complex input scenarios, such as multi-device support or input rebinding.
### New Input System:
- Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture:  
The new Input System is built on top of Unity's Entity Component System, making it more efficient and scalable.
- Input System Package:  
It's available as a separate package in Unity, allowing for modular use and updates independent of the engine itself.
- Input Action Asset:  
The Input System introduces the concept of Input Action Assets, which define reusable sets of input actions that can be easily configured and reused across projects.
- Rebinding Support:  
It provides built-in support for input rebinding, allowing users to remap controls easily without having to write custom code.
- Advanced Features:  
It offers advanced features like input interactions (e.g., hold, tap, swipe), composite controls (e.g., two-axis input like WASD), and multi-device support out-of-the-box.
- Performance:  
The new system is designed for better performance, especially in scenarios with high-frequency input polling or complex input handling requirements.

## Points of Excellence
### Old Input System:
- Simplicity:  
It's straightforward to use, especially for simpler projects, prototypes or beginners.
- Familiarity:  
Developers who have been using Unity for a long time might find it easier to stick with the old system due to familiarity.
### New Input System:
- Flexibility:  
It's highly flexible (multiple device support) and can handle complex input scenarios more efficiently.
- Performance:  
Offers better performance, since events consume fewer resources than constantly checking for input in the Update() function
- Extensibility:  
The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization to fit specific project needs.
- Rebinding Support:  
Built-in support for input rebinding makes it easier to cater to a wider audience with different control preferences.

## Summary
In summary, while the old Input System might suffice for simpler projects or for those who prefer its familiarity, the new Input System offers advanced features, better performance, and more flexibility, making it the preferred choice for many developers, especially for larger and more complex projects.
