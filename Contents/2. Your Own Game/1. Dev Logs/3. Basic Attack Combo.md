# What should a basic attack implementation look like in Crusadeon?
In Crusadeon the player has multiple ways to fight enemies, their main weapon will be their basic attack. The basic attack is not on a cooldown, this makes it the player’s main weapon to fight. Because of this the feel of this attack greatly impacts how the whole game plays/feels to play.

## How did I solve this?
From the start the basic attack was designed to be a combo of 3 attacks, there were no further requirements at the time for me to take into account. So I made more requirements together with the creative director, these requirements were:
The player shouldn’t have to time their clicks to attack, with the basic attack.
Since this will be a fast paced game we want the player to aim their attack and not worry about getting the timing right.
The player should attack and look in the direction of the cursor (when playing with a mouse and keyboard).
When the player is playing with a mouse and keyboard, attacking based on movement direction from the WASD keys felt clunky when playing, it also didn’t give the player enough freedom. With these keys the player could only attack in 8 directions versus the freedom a mouse or joystick provides.
The player moves forward with each attack.
When attacking with a sword someone would move a bit forward to generate more power for their strike, we want to simulate this in Crusadeon. This also means the player won’t be able to attack while walking backwards, since when they do they move in the direction of the attack.
During the combo the player can change the direction of their attack (after the attack animation is done).
This gives the player more freedom while attacking.

After defining these requirements I could start to implement them into the player prototype.

## What is the result?
The first feature of the list that was implemented was the attack animations, playing them back to back without interrupting the animations. This meant waiting till the animation was finished before starting the next one. I could also add forward motion to the animation so the player moves forward while the attack animation is playing.

## What is the quality of the result?
This point of the prototype has been tested by the other developers of our studio, because the forward movement was tied to the animation, attacking felt very stuttery. It felt like it would destroy the player's immersion, so this had to be changed in a later iteration.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The forward movement needs to be separated from the animation, but first I will make sure the player can rotate, to see what the animation will work when rotating the player.
