# How should attack direction be determined?
The direction of attacks can be determined in 2 ways for mouse and keyboard, by movement input or with the position of the cursor. 
The requirement for direction based on position of the cursor did have arguments for not using the directional input, but it had not been tested. 

## How did I solve this?
I made a prototype which turns with the directional input from the player and tested this with the other members of the studio. 
After everyone had tested it I made a prototype to test the attack direction based on the cursor position. 

## What is the result?
I found out that attacking in a direction based on movement input does not feel great with a mouse and keyboard, 
but it does work well when playing with a gamepad. Attacking in the direction of your mouse cursor works really well when
playing with mouse and keyboard. The decision was made to keep the movement input based attack direction for gamepads, but
for now continue with the cursor position and focus on mouse and keyboard.   
I also found that the movement in the animation always moves the player toward the world Z direction and not the player Z direction,
because of this the player would not move in the right direction when attacking, so this is another reason for the movement to be removed from the animation.

## What is the quality of the result?
For now it is tested by the developers in the studio, at the end of the 2nd sprint Crusadeon will be playtested with people outside of the studio.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?
The next step will be to remove the movement from the animation and make the player go forward when attacking in a different way.
