| The lack of customizability made it a bit worse - I wanted to change some of the buttons to better fit my playstyle but I couldn't do that |
| Aiming felt a lot more natural when using keyboard and mouse. Controller aiming felt rather clunky |
| make controls more explicit |
| its not always clear what the keybinds are |

| They were glitchy so half the time they didn't respond the way I expected them to according to the indicators |
| Some indicators seemed larger than the actual AoE of the ability itself |

## Describe how you used the blackhole ability.
|         Answers          |
|:------------------------:|
| Didn't use it            |
| I tested it out shortly and as soon as I saw it didn't do damage and had a pretty small pull range, I categorized it as weak and didn't use it. |
| Whenever I felt like there were multiple enemies in one place that I could group up and immobilize |
| not                      |
| trap many enemies        |
| i ddidnt                 |

| -                        |
| Give it a hitbox, and/or increase the range - not sure if it effects the bigger enemies, but if they don't this ability simply sucks |
| Felt slightly disappointing that the suction area was smaller than expected and didn't look like it dealt any damage. Not sure whether it has any significant link to the aesthetic either |
| -                        |
| it took too long to deploy, when you use it you almost always take damage |

## Describe how you used the laser ability.
|         Answers          |
|:------------------------:|
| To deal damage -_-       |
| I did the big kill       |
| Used right after the black hole in the hopes of hitting as many enemies as possible with it |
| to deal damage           |
| blackhole + laser = death|

|:------------------------:|
| -                        |
| Sometimes the big charge guys just kinda walked right out of them, and they're completely invisible while they're in there, so I can't see them charging at me, so I'd probably either make them more visible while they're still alive, or just kill them faster |
| It certainly did feel like a sort of ''divine smite'' |
| -                        |
| its not effective on the bezerkers |

## Explain your last answer.
|         Answers          |
|:------------------------:|
| I didn't get hit by them once. |
| They take more hits, but they're not especially threatening as long as you're aware of them; the spear throwers are much more threatening, since they can attack from a distance, so I take those out first, and the smaller guys just kinda die anyway |
| They felt more annoying and resilient than the usual enemy |
| they are more dangerous  |
| they deal a lot of damage but when they charge you can take them down |
| he deals too much damage!! |

## Do you have any remarks in regard to the Berserker? (Optional)
|         Answers          |
|:------------------------:|
| -                        |
| The movement felt like it should've been a charge in a straight line, but instead it just pathfinds to the player's location when the charge starts, and that leads to some really weird animations, especially when he makes a sharp turn at the end and then just stops |

## What did you enjoy most about the game?
|         Answers          |
|:------------------------:|
| The boss because all the other enemies besides the berserker are abusable, while the berserker never touched me with his charge |
| Yeeting spear            |
| Using the laser ability, it seemed like it could become the most overpowered and fun-to-use ability in the game |
| movement and use of abilities |
| combat                   |
| the feeling of murdering people |
