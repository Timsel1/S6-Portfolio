## What do you like/dislike about them?

| Opinion|
|:------------------------------------|
| ik vind het een cool concept  |
| I like em, just often too intense for casual play :-)   |
| I like the progression and strategic way of combining previously learned mechanics with a more powerful one.|
| =I like the randomness of them.|
| I tend to like long-form games more, and in rogue-lites it's short-term in a form where it still has long-term progression, which is only interesting if the game's story works well within that context, though I prefer if everything is just unlocked at the start - it's random anyway y'know |
| Procedural stuff, plenty of combos of abilities and attacks; I dislike repetitive stuff|

| Spear seemed to miss a lot, sacred wave seemed not to do much, judgment just looks awesome                                               |
| Was mainly trying them out than using it strategically.                                                                                  |
| Deze vond ik het beste om te gebruiken omdat je midden in een groep vijanden kan staan en ze allemaal in een keer kan knockbacken.       |
| I tended to just spam buttons which was very effective :P - the sacred wave feels like it doesn't do damage tho so even if I used that it didn't feel great, and in contrast judgment felt the most powerful |

| no button sounds                                                   |
| attack SFX seems not perfectly in sync with the movement           |
| Music is already intense without a lot of enemies. Feels less intense the longer you play. |
