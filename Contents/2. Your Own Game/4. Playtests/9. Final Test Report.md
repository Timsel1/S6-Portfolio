# Final Test Report

This report outlines the findings from the final playtest of Crusadeon. The playtest aimed to gather feedback on controller support, ability indicators, the blackhole and laser abilities, and the new enemy, the Berserker. Participants played the game on a laptop using either a controller or keyboard/mouse, and their feedback was collected through a survey.

This report will also include the findings from the indicator survey, since indicators were part of th final playtest.

## 1. Input Method Preferences

Participants were asked which input method they preferred for playing the game. The majority preferred the keyboard/mouse, with only one participant opting for the controller. This indicates a general favor towards traditional input methods over the controller. This was partly due to some issues which came forth during the playtest in regards to the controller.

## 2. Controller Support

### Control Scheme Intuitiveness

Participants rated the intuitiveness of the control schemes for both keyboard/mouse and controller. The keyboard/mouse received a higher average rating (3.67) compared to the controller (2.50). This suggests that the keyboard/mouse control scheme was more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Comparison of Control Effectiveness

When asked if the controller provided better control compared to the keyboard/mouse, the responses averaged at 2.00. Most participants felt the controller did not offer better control, with a few "no significant difference" answers. 

### Sense of Power

Participants indicated that the keyboard/mouse made them feel more powerful during gameplay. This aligns with the preference and higher effectiveness ratings for keyboard/mouse controls.

### Remarks on Input Devices

Some participants mentioned a lack of customizability in the controller layout, making it less adaptable to personal playstyles. Aiming with the keyboard/mouse was noted as more natural, while the controller was described as clunky. There were also suggestions to make control schemes more explicit and keybinds clearer.

**Summary:**
- The keyboard/mouse control scheme was preferred for its intuitiveness and natural feel.
- The controller was found less effective and did not enhance the sense of control or power.
- Improvements needed include customization options and clearer control instructions.

## 3. Indicators

### Contribution to Game’s Aesthetics

Participants generally agreed that the indicators contributed well to the game’s aesthetics, with an average rating of 4.17. This suggests that the indicators are visually aligned with the game’s theme.

### Clarity in Aiming Abilities

The clarity of indicators in aiding aim was rated with an average of 3.50. While the indicators were somewhat helpful, there is room for improvement in their precision and reliability.

### Remarks on Ability Indicators

Some feedback pointed out glitches in the indicators, leading to unexpected responses. There were also comments on the size of indicators not matching the actual Area of Effect (AoE) of abilities and the inability to cancel actions based on indicators.

**Summary:**
- Indicators were well-received in terms of aesthetics but need enhancements for clarity and reliability.
- Addressing glitches and ensuring indicator sizes match AoEs could improve user experience.

## 4. Blackhole Ability

### Enjoyment and Perceived Power

The blackhole ability received mixed reviews, with an average enjoyment rating of 2.83 and a perceived power rating of 2.33. Participants found it less enjoyable and powerful compared to other abilities.

### Usage Patterns

Most participants either did not use the blackhole ability or found it weak. Those who used it did so to group and immobilize enemies, though it was often considered ineffective.

### Remarks on Blackhole Ability

Participants suggested improvements such as adding a hitbox, increasing the range, and speeding up deployment. The suction area was noted to be smaller than expected and lacking in impact.

**Summary:**
- The blackhole ability was not well-received and is viewed as underwhelming.
- Consider revising its functionality to enhance its effectiveness and appeal.

## 5. Laser Ability

### Enjoyment and Perceived Power

The laser ability was well-received, with high enjoyment (4.50) and power (4.67) ratings. Participants enjoyed using it and felt it made them powerful.

### Usage Patterns

The laser ability was primarily used to deal damage, sometimes in combination with the blackhole ability to maximize effectiveness.

### Remarks on Laser Ability

Some participants noted that certain enemies, like the Berserkers, were not affected effectively by the laser. There were also concerns about the visibility of enemies while they were under the laser effect.

**Summary:**
- The laser ability was highly effective and enjoyable for players.
- Minor adjustments could enhance its performance against specific enemies and improve visibility.

## 6. Berserker Enemy

### Animation Quality

The Berserker’s animations received an average rating of 3.17. Feedback suggested some issues with animation fluidity, particularly during charge attacks.

### Difficulty

Participants rated the Berserker’s difficulty at an average of 3.00, indicating a balanced challenge. However, opinions varied on how difficult it was to deal with the Berserker.

### Thematic Fit

The Berserker fit well within the game's theme, with a high average rating of 4.33. This suggests the character design and behavior align well with the overall game aesthetics.

### Perceived Strength

The perceived strength of the Berserker compared to other enemies averaged 3.67. Some participants found it stronger, while others did not perceive it as a significant threat.

### Priority Over Other Enemies

Participants were split on whether the Berserker should be prioritized over other enemies. Those who did not prioritize it felt it was less threatening, while those who did found it more resilient and dangerous.

### Remarks on Berserker

Feedback indicated issues with the Berserker’s movement and attack animations, particularly during charge sequences. Bugs and pathfinding issues were noted as areas needing improvement.

**Summary:**
- The Berserker is well-integrated into the game’s theme but needs improvements in animation and attack mechanics.
- The difficulty level is appropriate, but addressing animation issues could enhance gameplay interactions.

## Advice
I would advice the 3 days we have left to be spent on quick fixes, like the blackhole ability and making sure the berserker doesn't get stuck in his attack state. After this I will work on trying to fix the ability indicators for controller as well as keyboard/mouse, keeping in mind there is also more feedback on aspects of the game other group members have worked on, they should choose their easiest fixes first. This way we can make our game as polished as possible before fontys' innovation inside event and we might even be able to submit it to the dutch game awards, just for fun.
