|What were your overall thoughts on the cartoony dark outlined visual style?|
|:------------------------------------------------:|
|It works with the overall look of the game and gameplay.	|
|^^)b|
|Nice and consistent visual style|
|Fits nice with the assets you are using.|
|I like the art style and would love to see gore :D|
|Looks pretty cool!|
|I really like the crisp look, just missing shadows on the characters.|
|It's good but add shadows|
|I like the outline style|
|It look great|

|What did you think about the combat?|
|:------------------------------------------------:|
|Overall good, but the special attacks get cancelled out end there is no way to know which items you have, what they do and when they are used.	|
|Easy to get tired|
|Not direct. Clunky could be good word. The special effects felt not powerfull enough|
|Animations where pretty cool and quite good already, but if this gets polished more and its no longer delayed or has proper player feedback it will make the combat more enjoyable for me.|
|It was good but the skill count is low I don't think I would play it more than once in its current state|
|It feels a little bit too slow. Movement is taken away for too long when performing skills, making it very hard to dodge enemy spears. Visually it's cool to see all attacks.|
| Fun and fast.|
|It needs some balancing and a bit more player feedback, but generally it feels quite fine - it's a bit standard enemy kiting and slashing, which isn't bad, but I'm missing a bit of a unique selling point|
|combat is fine|
|Sometimes feels a bit slow, but other than that it's fine|

|somethimes, only the spear hitbox when i aim is weird|
|Yes, but what the effect is is unclear. Enemies feel like sponges|
|Yes|

|Yes|
|Yes|

|What did you think about the animations?|
|:--------------------------------------:|
|Nice|
|wonky|
|Not all animations felt grounded|
|Love the build up of the attack animations|
|Good|
|prefer them to be slightly faster.|
|Loving the roll|
|Very standard but they do the job - the VFX are really awesome|
|animations look very good|
|Recovery was a bit long in my opinion|

|The control scheme is written in a particular style of font. Did you find the font used here fitting with the setting?|	
|:------------------------------------------------:|
|Yes|
|Maybe add a small outline to the text to give that medieval some cartoonish feel. fits the whole theme |
|Don't care about the font|
|Yes|
|Yes|
|Yes|
|Didn't notice|
|Yes|
|Yes|
|Yes|
|![Playtest2-7](https://github.com/Timsel1/S6-Portfolio/assets/90602424/8b7446ba-b2c4-4f81-9e52-83c6fec33ad9)|

|Do the abilities overall feel good to use?|
|:------------------------------------------------:|
|Yes|
|the spear hitbox when i aim is weird|
|No|
|No|
|I think they can have a bit more weight to them but they feel good|
|Mostly yes, with an exception for the smite, which takes too long to trigger and leaves you very vurnerable.|
|Yeah, but I feel they take a bit too long to activate so I need to time it well|
|Spear feels very committal, Smite is even more committal and feels pretty weak with how small the range is and how large the cooldown is, and knockback just feels completely useless in most situations because it doesn't do damage|
|Yes|
|Yes|
