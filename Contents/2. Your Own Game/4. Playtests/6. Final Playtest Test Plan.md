## Objectives of the Playtest
This final playtest aims to gather detailed feedback on specific game elements to ensure they meet the desired standards for gameplay experience and usability. The focus will be on evaluating the controller support, the effectiveness of visual indicators, the blackhole and laser abilities, and the new enemy, the Berserker. Participants will provide insights into these areas through direct interaction and feedback, helping us refine and enhance the game before its final release.
- __Controller Support__
  - The New Button Layout:  
Evaluate how intuitively players can use the new controller button layout and how quickly they adapt to it.  
  - Control Comparison:  
Determine if players feel they have more precise control using the controller compared to the keyboard/mouse. This includes their ability to navigate, execute actions, and interact with game mechanics.
  - Enhancement of the Sensation Aesthetic:  
Assess how well the controller supports the sensation aesthetic. This is a follow up to the `Control Comparison`, do people feel more powerful with the controller, because of (e.g.) better control over their character and abilities.
- __Indicators__
  - __Aesthetic Complement:__  
Evaluate whether the indicators visually fit within the overall game aesthetic. This includes their design, placement, and how they integrate with the game’s environment and visual style.
  - __Clarity and Effectiveness:__  
Determine how clear and useful the indicators are in helping players aim and execute abilities. This includes the ease with which players can interpret the indicators and their impact on gameplay precision.
- __Blackhole Ability__
  - __Player Enjoyment:__  
Measure how much players enjoy using the blackhole ability. This includes the fun factor and any satisfaction derived from its use.
  - __Perceived Power:__  
Assess whether players feel powerful when using the blackhole ability. This involves the perceived impact and effectiveness of the ability during gameplay.
  - __Usage Patterns:__  
Understand how players typically use the blackhole ability. This includes their strategies, frequency of use, and the contexts in which they choose to activate it.
- __Laser Ability:__
  - __Player Enjoyment:__
    Measure how much players enjoy using the laser ability. This includes the fun factor and any satisfaction derived from its use.
  - __Perceived Power:__
    Assess whether players feel powerful when using the laser ability. This involves the perceived impact and effectiveness of the ability during gameplay.
  - __Usage Patterns:__
    Understand how players typically use the laser ability. This includes their strategies, frequency of use, and the contexts in which they choose to activate it.
- __Berserker Enemy:__
  - __Animations:__
    Evaluate participants' thoughts on the Berserker’s animations. This includes the fluidity, realism, and overall appeal of the animations.
  - __Attack:__  
Gather feedback on the Berserker’s attack patterns. This includes their perceived difficulty, impact, and any unique mechanics.
  - __Thematic Fit:__  
Assess if the Berserker fits within the game's theme. This includes the enemy's design, behavior, and integration into the game’s world.
  - __Strength:__  
Determine how strong players perceive the Berserker to be. This includes its challenge level compared to other enemies.
  - __Priority:__  
Understand if players feel the need to prioritize the Berserker over other enemies. This includes their reasoning and any strategies employed.

## Test Procedure

- **Introduction**
  - Greet participants and provide a brief introduction to the game and the purpose of the playtest.
  - Explain the focus areas: controller support, indicators, and the blackhole ability.
  - Inform participants about the feedback form they will fill out after playing.

  - **Observation:**  
Observe participants' interactions with the game, particularly noting their use of controllers, how they interact with indicators, and how they use the blackhole ability.

- **Post-Play Feedback**
  - Provide participants with a feedback form immediately after gameplay.
  - Ensure the form covers specific questions related to each focus area.
