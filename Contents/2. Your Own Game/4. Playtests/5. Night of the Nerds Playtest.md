# Night of the Nerds Playtest
## My objective:
To evaluate the overall gameplay experience of Night of the Nerds, with a specific focus on the implementation of controller support.

## Test Setup:
- Location: TQ-4.2
- Equipment: Laptop with a Crusadeon build installed, choice between controller and keyboard and mouse and a screen playing the trailer for the game
- Participants: Random passerby 

## Methodology:
- Introduction:  
  - Greet participants and provide a brief introduction to the game.
- Play Session:  
  - Allow each participant to play the game using their preferred input method (keyboard/mouse or controller).
  - Observe how each participant plays the game.
-  Data Collection:
  - Verbal Feedback: After the play session, ask participants the following questions:
    - (If using a controller) How do you find the controller support in the game?
    - (If using a controller) How easy was it to use the controller with the game?
    - (If using a controller) What do you think about the button layout and control scheme?
- Observations: 
  - The number of participants who chose to play using the controller vs. keyboard/mouse.
  - The ease with which participants adapt to the chosen input method.
  - Any visible confusion or difficulty with the controls.
  - Any spontaneous comments or reactions during gameplay.
- Data Analysis:
  - Popularity of Input Methods:
    - Measure the number of participants who preferred using the controller versus those who used the keyboard/mouse.
    - Analyze any patterns or preferences related to different demographics.
  - Ease of Use:
    - Compare feedback on the intuitiveness and user-friendliness of both input methods.
    - Pay special attention to comments on the controller support and ease of use.
  - Control Scheme Evaluation:
    - Assess feedback regarding the button layout and overall control scheme for both input methods.
    - Identify common issues or areas where players struggled.
## Summary of Findings
- Popularity of Input Methods:  
Controller is by far the most popular input method. This is based on the fact that close to everyone chose the controller over keyboard and mouse. The people that chose to play with keyboard and mouse were the older crowd.
Conclusion: the younger crowd (closest to our target audience) picked the controller. Older players had a preference for keyboard and mouse.
- Ease of Use & Control Scheme Evaluation:  
There was 1 big problem with the controller, this was related to how abilities worked in combination with the controller. Aiming abilities was a pain, since the ability would go in the direction the character was facing, this behaviour is intended, but because of the turning speed of the character aiming proved to be extremely difficult. This problem had been fixed for the basic attack, I was under the impression the abilities didnâ€™t have this problem, so this was an oversight on my end. Other than that the feedback on the use of the controller was overwhelmingly positive. The controls felt intuitive and no other issues came forth.
