## Explain your last answer.

|Answers|
|:--------:|
|I know where they will hit before I use them|
|Without the indicators there is no real way to know the hitboxes without trial and error. This way the player will know the hitboxes from the start of the game instead of having to learn them by feeling.|
|I could see exactly what area would get hit with the ability I used, and it seemed to be consistent|
|Without the indicator it's not very clear where your attack will go or the area of effect. The indicator improves this a lot.|

## Explain your last answer. 

|Answers|
|:--------:|
|Feels the same to me|
|At least the second batch of indicators are visually very fitting. It definitely doesn't break immersion, it might even help as it feels magical.|
|Indicators help me with visualization, not so much immersion.|
|It doesn't add or detract from the immersion for me.|
