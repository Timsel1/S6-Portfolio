## Objectives of the Playtest
The goal of the validation playtest is to gather feedback on specific game elements to verify they have the expected effects on the player’s experience and enhance the power fantasy sensation. The focus will be on evaluating the controller support, the effectiveness of visual indicators, and the blackhole ability within the game. Participants will provide insights into these areas through direct interaction and feedback, helping me refine and enhance these aspects before showing the final product.
- __Controller Support__
  - The New Button Layout:  
Evaluate how intuitively players can use the new controller button layout and how quickly they adapt to it.  
  - Control Comparison:  
Determine if players feel they have more precise control using the controller compared to the keyboard/mouse. This includes their ability to navigate, execute actions, and interact with game mechanics.
  - Enhancement of the Sensation Aesthetic:  
Assess how well the controller supports the sensation aesthetic. This is a follow up to the `Control Comparison`, do people feel more powerful with the controller, because of (e.g.) better control over their character and abilities.
- __Indicators__
  - __Aesthetic Complement:__  
Evaluate whether the indicators visually fit within the overall game aesthetic. This includes their design, placement, and how they integrate with the game’s environment and visual style.
  - __Clarity and Effectiveness:__  
Determine how clear and useful the indicators are in helping players aim and execute abilities. This includes the ease with which players can interpret the indicators and their impact on gameplay precision.
  - __Blackhole Ability__
  - __Player Enjoyment:__  
Measure how much players enjoy using the blackhole ability. This includes the fun factor and any satisfaction derived from its use.
  - __Perceived Power:__  
Assess whether players feel powerful when using the blackhole ability. This involves the perceived impact and effectiveness of the ability during gameplay.
  - __Usage Patterns:__  
Understand how players typically use the blackhole ability. This includes their strategies, frequency of use, and the contexts in which they choose to activate it.

## Test Procedure

- **Introduction**
  - Greet participants and provide a brief introduction to the game and the purpose of the playtest.
  - Explain the focus areas: controller support, indicators, and the blackhole ability.
  - Inform participants about the feedback form they will fill out after playing.

- **Play Session**
  - **Duration:**  
Allow each participant to play once with both input devices until they die or for a max of ~10 minutes. (Player’s choice)
  - **Input Choice:**  
Let participants choose their preferred input method (controller or keyboard/mouse) for their first round.
  - **Observation:**  
Observe participants' interactions with the game, particularly noting their use of controllers, how they interact with indicators, and how they use the blackhole ability.

- **Post-Play Feedback**
  - Provide participants with a feedback form immediately after gameplay.
  - Ensure the form covers specific questions related to each focus area.



## Evaluation Criteria

- **Controller Support**
   - **Effectiveness of Button Layout:**  
Players are able to adapt and use the new layout.
   - **Control Comparison:**  
Players’ perceptions of control using the controller vs. keyboard/mouse is close to equal.
   - **Sensation Mechanic:**  
The controller doesn’t worsen the sensation aesthetic.

- **Indicators**
   - **Aesthetic Contribution:**  
Indicators should fit with the game's visual style.
   - **Clarity and Utility:**  
Indicators should be clear and aid in gameplay, particularly in aiming abilities.

   - **Enjoyment:**  
The level of enjoyment players experience using the ability should be at least equal to other abilities.
   - **Perceived Power:**  
Players should feel powerful using the blackhole ability.
   - **Usage:**
