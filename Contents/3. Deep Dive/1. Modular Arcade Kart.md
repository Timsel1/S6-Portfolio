# Modular Arcade Kart 

As my deep dive challenge I want to create a github repo/unity package, that allows game developers to easily set up an arcade kart for their arcade racing game. This entails that multiple karts/characters can be created based on a base kart and stats can be modified to create a different feel for every kart. The stats will be made with scriptable objects, to allow for easy stat modification and different behaviours.
The behaviours that will be editable entail things like:  
- Speed 
- Acceleration 
- Turning radius 
- Drifting (sharpness) 
- Auto drift or manual drift 
- Sliding out 
- Bumping
- Speed boosts 
- Slow downs

__Design Challenge:__   
Implement a modular kart customization system with scriptable objects for adjustable stats and behaviors, allowing game developers to easily create diverse arcade karts within a Unity package/github repo.

## How did I solve this?
To start I looked at games I wanted my project to be based off of. I landed on 3 games that represent what I want to create and be able to modify, these games are:
- Mario Kart Wii
- Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing
- Pacman (World) Rally
