# Code Management
To manage my code, I followed the same guidelines, as described in the manifesto and code convention, with a focus on clear Git commits and using a structured Gitflow.
### Git Commits
When writing Git commits, I adhered to the guidelines set out in the Rogue Ape Studio manifesto to ensure readability. My commit messages always start with the appropriate gitmoji and prefixes such as Add, Fix, Update, etc. This made it clear what the purpose of the commit was. This made sure I have clear history of commits.

I did work on a private repository and later added the necessary files to a public repository that I could share with the teachers. The reason for this was personal use, if I ever want to create a karting game from this project I can use the private repository and continue to work there.


### Gitflow
### Git Flow
To structure my project code, I used the Gitflow method. There is a Master branch for production, a Development branch for staging,
I will create separate branches for individual developments like features or bugfixes. 
When a feature is finished I will merge it into the develop branch. No reviews are needed since I’m the only one who’s working on this project and I won’t merge broken features to my develop branch.
The result was a structured and well-managed codebase.
