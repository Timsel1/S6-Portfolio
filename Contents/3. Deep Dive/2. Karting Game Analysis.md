## Mario Kart
Mario Kart Wii, released in 2008 for the Nintendo Wii console, is one entry in the long-running Mario Kart series. It combines the charm of Mario characters and settings with fast paced racing gameplay, making it the second most sold game for the Nintendo Wii.

## Aesthetics 
Mario Kart’s aesthetics are:
- Competition:
Since Mario kart is a racing game, people naturally want to win, beating your opponents is one of the goals of the game.

- Fellowship:
Mario kart was released on the Wii, a family gaming console. The game could be played with friends and family in the split screen mode.

- Submission:
Players will improve over time, one of the challenges in the game are its time trials. A player is able to unlock expert time trial ghosts by improving their time on a map. Records are also kept track of, improving to beat a record could take a long time.

## Dynamics
Since I'm making creating modular karts, I will be focusing on the aesthetics competition and submission. Since these aesthetics focus mostly on how well the player can/will do, which in turn changes their driving behaviour.

- Hop Trick: 
Gain extra height for a jump by pressing the hop (drift) and trick button at the same time. This can be used to skip certain parts of maps.

- Hop Skips:
Using a boost (mini-turbo, mushroom, etc) and hopping, parts of maps can be skipped. This is done without using a trick since the parts of the map where this is used don't have a jump thus the player cannot perform a trick. (e.g. the last turn on the map mushroom gorge)

- Neutral Hopping: 
This is simply hopping without any other button input. It is best used on uphill sections, preserves mini-turbo speed and can also adjust your vehicle’s angle coming out of a boost section.

- Bunny Hopping / Fire Hopping: 
This only works on flat or uphill ground. For this technique players hop left or right multiple times after a speed boost, increasing the length of time at a greater speed. It can also help you to realign if you are too tight or wide leaving the corner.

- Slip Drift:
A strategy that is used to start a drift, without doing a full hop. Since a drift starts after a hop, skipping the hop would make your drift start quicker, this way less time is spent to get a mini-turbo.

- Delayed Drifting:
After performing a wheelie, hop and wait a short period of time to steer in the direction you want to drift. This way a mini-turbo can be obtained quicker.

### Driving mechanics
- Accelerate:  
When drivers hold down the corresponding button, the vehicle goes forward. Accelerating time depends on the type of karts: 
  - Lightweight karts have a high acceleration but low speed. 
  - Heavyweight karts tend to have a low acceleration but a high top speed. 
  - Middleweight karts tend to have an average top speed and acceleration.

- Steer:  
Steering lets drivers move around corners.

- Brake:  
Braking slows the vehicle to an abrupt stop.

- Reverse:  
The driver's kart goes backwards if the driver continues holding the brake button after the vehicle comes to a stop. If a vehicle reaches maximum top speed, the vehicle will drift instead. If the player tries to accelerate while going in reverse, the vehicle will start to build momentum. When blue sparks start to appear, the player can release the brakes to get a small speed of boost.

- Look Behind:  
Drivers can look behind their vehicles. In this way, drivers can be alert from other drivers incoming to steal their place. Drivers can also use this feature to see where they are going while backing up, or to aim a weapon at an opponent following up.

- Drift:  
Drivers drift to keep the vehicle's speed and take corners more easily, with the benefit of getting Mini-Turbos. The feature can be set to happen automatically or when a button is held, although Mini-Turbos cannot be obtained on the automatic setting.

- Slipstream:
By driving behind other player for a period of time, the player can obtain slipstream, giving them a small speed boost for a short period of time.

- Rocket Start:  
Drivers can perform a speed boost when a race begins. If drivers hold down the corresponding acceleration button right after the countdown timer displays the number 2, then they will receive an extra speed boost when the word "GO!" appears on the screen. However, if drivers hold down the button for too long, when the final beep is heard, their engine bursts and they get an even worse start than a regular one and take a few seconds to recover.

- Mini-Turbo:  
When drivers drift for a reasonable amount of time depending on the vehicle used, blue sparks erupt from the vehicle's rear tires. Releasing the drift button gives them a short burst of speed. In a kart, drivers can keep drifting for longer periods to get orange sparks and a longer boost. However, orange sparks cannot be created on bikes. The amount of time the player must drift also depends on the vehicle's drifting stats. Drivers can also perform a "standing Mini-Turbo" by holding the brake/drift and acceleration buttons at the same time. This is helpful for vehicles with slow acceleration, as it will get the vehicle to top speed. A Mini-Turbo cannot be performed when drifting is set to automatic, but the standing Mini-Turbo can.

- Jumps:  
If players jump over ramps or mushrooms, the length of the jump can be controlled by Control Pad up (shorter jump) and Control Pad down (longer jump).

- Tricks:  
Drivers can pull off a trick when they jump in order to gain a momentary Mini-Turbo.They obtain a speed boost when landing.

- Wheelie:  
Wheelies can be performed only when drivers are riding bikes. Drivers can increase their speed by lifting up the fronts of their bikes. While drivers perform a wheelie, the bike cannot be easily steered. The wheelie can be ended by braking, hopping, waiting for the wheelie to end, or simply setting the Wii Wheel or Wii Remote back down. If drivers are bumped into while they are performing a wheelie, they lose most of their speed. If they wheelie again right as their wheelie runs out, they can get a chain wheelie.
