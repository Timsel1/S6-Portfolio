# S6-Portfolio Tim Meijvogel

During my 6th semester at Fontys ICT I followed the course Advanced game Design and Technology (GDT-A). This course is made up of 3/4 projects. 
These projects are:
- [Strange Devices](Contents/1.%20Strange%20Devices):  
  Groups are made and receive 1 strange device idea. Three minigames had to be made with the received device. The goal of this assignment was to get back into game design and get to know your classmates.
- [Your Own Game](Contents/2.%20Your%20Own%20Game):  
  The Your Own Game project. Now that you got to know your classmates and know their strengths, form groups to start your own game studio and design a game for the dragon's den. During the development of the game, write devlogs that show your contribution and show your growth as a game developer, based on the [Learning Outcomes](Contents/Learning%20Outcomes.md).
- Deep Dive:  
  Deep Dives are clear, contained challenges with deliverables intended to be consumed by the many. The workload is about two weeks including transfer and documentation. The emphasis of the Deep Dive challenge lies in producing high-quality outcomes that are both valuable and practical.
- Industry Project:  
  If during the dragon's den you haven't received a green light to continue working on the YOG project, you will have to do an industry project. This is a project for a client, most likly outside of Fontys. The industry project will look like this:
  - Kick-off and debrief  
    During or before the kick-off meeting the industry partners will present their projects.
    You will discuss the project with the client, and send them a debrief.
    Make appointments for (ideally all) the sprint demos. Invite the client and your teacher coaches.
  - Sprints
      - Sprint 0: Analysis  
        We expect you to define a project with a client and refine it in a project plan. 
        You give a concept pitch where you present your initial concept to the client.
      - Sprint 1: First Playable 
        You refine the concept based on client feedback.
        You have your first playable prototype with low/no tech where you validate the core mechanics of your game.
      - Sprint 2: Vertical Slice  
        At the end of this sprint you have a first vertical slice of your game. The game should be feature complete at this point, but not content complete (placeholders assets, limited amount of levels etc.)
      - Sprint 3: MVP  
        The end result of this sprint is a fully functional and potentially shippable MVP. It could be a bit rough around the edges but all functionality should be complete.
      - Sprint 4: Validation and transfer  
        At this sprint no new features may be added, only gold plating and polishing. The goal of this sprint is to validate the quality of your product by having it tested by the target audience.
        Ensure a smooth transfer to the client.
        You present your work to the public at the FHICT Innovations Insight event.
